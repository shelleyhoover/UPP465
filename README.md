# Web GIS - UPP 465 2022

## Course Description
Web GIS is a popular term commonly used to refer to "online maps". While professional definitions are usually much more technical, "online maps" is a good starting point.

The goal of this course is to enable students to build their own online maps using two popular tools: ArcGIS Online (AGOL) and Leaflet.js. Students will gain the technical knowledge to create interactive online maps while learning the principals of effective map design & visualizations.

We will also survey crowdsourced mapping tools such as Open Street Maps, as well as other propriety web mapping tools. While learning these tools, we will discuss current topics concerning online maps such as privacy, how maps can misrepresent information, or how they can effectively engage stakeholder groups.  

## Prerequisites:  

Students are expected to have basic familiarity with GIS terms and concepts prior to taking this course. Students with no previous GIS exposure have been successful in the course with additional work.  If you have no prior GIS experience, please contact the instructor (Shelley Hoover, shhoover@uic.edu). 

Students are not expected to have any prior programming knowledge and will learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the course.  

The pace of this course is fast.  Because many of the lessons build upon previous assignments, students are expected to meet deadlines and request assistance when necessary.

## Evaluation

Student performance will be evaluated on the basis of seven assignments and class participation. Optional extra credit will be introduced in Week 4. 

|  Total          |                        |
|:-----:          |:----------------------:|
|  30 points      | Participation          |
|  120 points     | Assignments            |    
|  **150 points** | **Total**              | 
|    10 points    | Extra Credit           |

**Assignments**

Assignments will be graded according to the rubric of each assignment, map design, functionality, and that the student demonstrates an understanding of the content. Additionally, each assignment is expected to adhere to the following expectations for a project log and map elements.  [**Required Project Log and Map Elements**](https://shelleyhoover.github.io/UPP4652022/#/Lessons/LogMapElements)

**Course Participation**

While students are encouraged to attend lectures, there is no attendance requirement. However, students are expected to provide feedback on each other's assignments. Receiving and giving feedback helps students understand how map visualizations are perceived better than instructor feedback alone. Each in-person lecture will begin with a short feedback session on maps, however if students are not in attendance they are expected to provide feedback via blackboard.  Students who participate in-lecture are not required to additionally provide feedback over blackboard.  

Students are expected to provide feedback concerning: 

1. What does this map tell you?
2. What was your impression of this map? Does it draw you in? Does it overwhelm you? 
3. Who do you think this map is for? 


## Late Policy
Coursework is expected to be submitted prior to the deadline. Deductions will be made for work submitted after the deadline, unless pre-arranged with the instructor.  Arrangements must be made prior to the deadline.
